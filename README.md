Check Your Understanding
Fill in your answers in your README.md

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   No, I would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application because the "message" feature is going to involve many functionalities/components, it's not a simple task that can be fully tested on using a unit test. 

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
   Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because checking whether a message has reached the max length or not is a specific and simple task that can be well tested using a unit test.
